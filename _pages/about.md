Hi! I'm Nichole Nomura, and I'm currently an Associate Director of the Stanford Literary Lab and a lecturer in the Department of English at Stanford. Before this, I was a  postdoctoral researcher at Stanford’s Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA) as a part of the Mellon Sawyer Seminar “The Data that Divides Us.” I received my Ph.D. in English from Stanford University with a Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities and am a graduate of Stanford's Graduate School of Education (M.A.). 

I study how literature teaches and is taught, English pedagogy, and Young Adult Literature, using methods from the digital humanities, literary criticism, and education. I am currently working on a book project, *Curricular Reading*, which argues for the affordances of reading literature like we do curricula. I'm also working on research collaborations to [co-design digital humanities curriculum for middle school](https://elalytics.stanford.edu/) and to map the disciplinary landscape of ELA in secondary and post-secondary curricula.
