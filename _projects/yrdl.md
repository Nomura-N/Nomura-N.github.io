The Young Readers Database of Literature (YRDL) is a collaboration between Stanford Literary Lab members and affiliates in the Stanford Graduate School of Education, the Stanford Department of English, and the Stanford Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages. The database contains rich metadata for over 30,000 works of childrenâ€™s, middle-grade, and YA fiction novels in English from the 20th and 21st century, including publisher information, readability metrics, and awards status, as well as a full-text corpus.
