I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford's Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA) as a part of the Mellon Sawyer Seminar "The Data that Divides Us." I lecture in the Department of English at Stanford, and am the Associate Director of Curriculum at the Stanford Literary Lab, a digital humanities research collective. 

I recieved my Ph.D. in English from Stanford University and am a graduate of Stanford's Graduate School of Education (M.A.). I study how science fiction teaches and is taught, English pedagogy, and Young Adult Literature, using methods from the digital humanities, literary criticism, and education.
