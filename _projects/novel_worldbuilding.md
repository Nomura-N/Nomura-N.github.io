This project, sponsored by the internationally-funded NovelTM grant (SSHRC), investigates science fiction's language using computational methods. How do authors of science fiction create and communicate new worlds? Our two computational methods detect two different kinds of worldbuilding in science fiction: a supervised learning approach that uses lexical feature sets from expert-tagged training data, and an operationalizing approach that identifies improbable pairs of known words, such as “sonic shower” or “laser gun.” We show that the two methods we’ve identified so far correspond to implicit and explicit worldbuilding, which allows us to study not just individual examples of how these two strategies are employed by authors at the level of the text, but also patterns that differentiate SF from other literary genres, and patterns that exist within the genre itself, especially when correlated with different measures of prestige
